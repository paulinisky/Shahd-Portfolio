        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Shahd started off with an outdated camcorder at the age of 8 filming
          what are now nostalgic home videos. She took interest in creating professional
          films in high school after joining the Audio Video production course which
          introduced her to the art of cinema. Shahd has worked on over 20 projects
          in the past 3 years. She is currently attending Houston Community College
          in hopes of gaining a degree in filmmaking by the end of 2021. </p>
        <p>Shahd lives with Cystic Fibrosis which has made following her dream
          difficult, but she never stopped. She was able to receive a double lung
          transplant at the end of 2019 with her Islamic beliefs being her ultimate
          motivation. Her script “Keep Breathing” is based on her own life experiences
          of a young girl who receives the call for her new lungs. By using her
          platform, Shahd’s goal is to be the voice of those who are unrecognized
          and unheard.  </p>
        <p>She won two awards in her high school’s film festival for two of her
          shorts; Most entertaining with best acting and 3rd place advertisement
          winner in 2016. Shahd also filmed and directed the school uniform commercial
          that was presented to the entire school the same year. She was a news
          anchor for her school’s journalism program. Shahd likes to go above and
          beyond to get magnificent results in her films.  She has a passion for
          painting and feels it has a strong connection to film. Both are a process
          that is rewarding to see in its completed state. </p>
